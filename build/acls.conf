# ACL configuration file for bind9. All required Access controls should be 
# created in this file.
# Imported into main configuration at '/opt/bind/named.conf'

# "none" - matches no hosts
# "any" - matches all hosts
# "localhost" - matches all the IP address(es) of the server on which BIND is
#   running e.g. if the server has a single interface with an IP address of 
#   192.168.2.3 then localhost will match 192.168.2.3 and 127.0.0.1 
#   (the loopback address is always present).
# "localnets" - matches all the IP address(es) and subnetmasks of the server on
#   which BIND is running i.e. if the server has a single interface with an IP 
#   address of 192.168.2.3 and a netmask of 255.255.255.0 (or 192.168.2.2/24)
#   then localnets will match 192.168.2.0 to 192.168.2.255 and 127.0.0.1 
#   (the loopback is assumed to be a single address). Some systems do not 
#   provide a way to determine the prefix lengths of local IPv6 addresses. In
#   such a case, localnets only matches the local IPv6 addresses, just like
#   localhost.
